    <title>Old Safety Systems Thinking and High Reliability Organization (HRO) Overview</title>
    <para>Today’s current state for knowledge management constructs lack a standardized approach to
        ensure the quality of data as it is entered or transferred into the health care and
        laboratory systems. Without a clear and repeatable way to verify the accuracy of information
        within an EHR or laboratory system, there are opportunities for hazards and patient safety
        issues to emerge. Our team will design a system based on a Safety Systems Thinking approach
        and High Reliability Organization (HRO) principles that can improve the quality,
        reliability, and interoperability of data and address the concerns with current knowledge
        management constructs. We will use prior work and research from industry leaders and subject
        matter experts (SMEs) as foundational building blocks as we continue to research laboratory
        and health care systems, medical terminology standards, and best practices and lessons
        learned to support our development and design process.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Motivation for Safety Systems Thinking and HRO</title>
        <para>The health care system in the United States has undergone a digital transformation
            over the past few decades as digital health information systems and EHRs have been
            widely adopted and implemented. Despite this expansive transformation, elements of
            interoperability, data quality management, and the associated patient safety risks are
            underrepresented as key subject matter experts and informatics stakeholders have not
            been optimally involved in the design and implementation process of health information
            systems.</para>
        <para>The current state for health care knowledge management to ensure data quality and
            interoperability is to encode health data using medical terminology standards such as,
            LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, and RxNorm. These terminologies provide a standardized method to
            create and enter data elements into health care systems and, in an ideal world, support
            seamless interoperability between health care systems or health record systems. However,
            the application and use of these standards is typically not consistent during
            implementations between facilities within a health care system or between different
            systems. This non-standardized implementation leads to localized variants of
            terminologies and knowledge representations that limit interoperability and impacts
            opportunities to comprehensively understand data within a system.</para>
        <para>Not only is the current knowledge management unstandardized, but relative uncertainty
            also exists regarding the quality and accuracy of the data representing knowledge. A
            standardized process to validate the vast amount health care data does not exist. The
            current situation further impacts the quality and accuracy of data, the ability to
            support research and clinical decisions, and patient safety. Existing data validation
            techniques need to be standardized and refined to support comprehensive and reproducible
            validation of data within systems and transferable data between systems.</para>

        <title>Safety Systems Thinking and HRO Background</title>
        <para>Improving existing knowledge management constructs requires an understanding of
            industry leading frameworks and principles. Safety Systems Thinking and HRO principles
            are two frameworks that will support the development of a standardized and repeatable
            knowledge management and data validation process with continual improvement.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Safety Systems Thinking Overview</title>
            <para>A systems thinking approach to safety is a thorough and disciplined approach to
                identifying, analyzing, eliminating, and controlling hazards by analysis, design,
                and management procedures that operate throughout a system’s life cycle. Hazards are
                created by unsafe conditions and processes that may lead to negative outcomes for
                stakeholders in the system, such as patients, providers, and researchers.</para>
            <para>Traditional approaches to safety view hazards as a linear chain of events and
                focus on eliminating component failures. However, a system thinking approach to
                safety attempts to eliminate hazards by examining the various hierarchical control
                structures and feedback loops that impact the conditions of a system.</para>
            <para>In systems thinking, analysis of the system begins in the early concept design
                stage and continually evaluates changes in the system or the environment that could
                indicate a shift to unsafe conditions. Reporting and information sharing channels
                are established, including hazard documentation, tracking, and resolution. These
                documentation channels are critical to support continual process improvement and are
                maintained throughout the lifespan of the system.</para>

        <title>Safety Systems Thinking and HRO Framework Considerations</title>
        <para>Following the rapid transition to EHRs, there is a desperate need to overhaul the
            current knowledge management constructs within the health care system to improve data
            quality and patient safety. While there will never be a perfectly safe system, an
            approach embedded in both Safety Systems Thinking and HRO principles can support major
            strides towards that goal. A combined approach will guide organizations through the
            successful implementation or redesign of systems to implement clear, concise, and
            standardized data validation techniques and support continuous process improvement
            through SME-led risk analysis and statistical, evidence-based review. </para>
        <para>It is not uncommon for other high-risk industries to adopt HRO principles. Commercial
            aviation and nuclear submarines are industries that adopted HRO based principles to
            enable substantial improvements to quality and safety. Pairing these principles with a
            systems-based approach to safety and proven tools like Statistical Process Control
            (SPC), Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), and Causal Analysis based on System
            Theory (CAST) will further improve the safety, standardization, and quality of systems
            and knowledge management constructs.</para>
        <para>As we use systems thinking and HRO principles to develop and design a system that
            addresses the existing flaws in the current knowledge management constructs, it is
            critical that we perform a comprehensive and proactive assessment of the pertinent
            laboratory and health care systems, their controls, best practices, and weaknesses.

            <title>Increasing the Value of Health Data by Engineering Safety, Quality, and High
                Reliability into the Data Life Cycle Overview</title>
            <para>In this 2022 paper by Dr. Keith E. Campbell et al., the team outlines an
                Independent Validation and Verification (IV&amp;V) approach that was designed with
                system safety, HRO principles, and statistical process control techniques. The
                generalized and iterative IV&amp;V sought to improve the quality and
                interoperability of data through a three-phased approach, error discovery and
                assessment, statistical process control, and continuous process improvement.</para>
            <para>By identifying and establishing feed forward pathways and baseline metrics for
                data and knowledge quality, the team provided a use-case for an IV&amp;V approach’s
                ability to statistically improve the quality and interoperability of prescription
                data. Dr. Campbell and team highlighted a variety of lessons learned that will need
                to be addressed to continue improvements to health care data, including the need to
                embed data and informatics SMEs into EHR modernization (EHRM) efforts and to expand

            <title>A Risk-Based Methodology for the Quality Assurance of Healthcare Knowledge
                Artifacts Overview</title>
            <para>Greg Rehwoldt outlines a real-world use case of developing and applying a
                risk-based methodology to improve the quality of current state knowledge artifacts
                in this 2018 dissertation. [20] This paper highlights a variety of issues with
                current state knowledge management, particularly the lack of effective quality
                assurance for existing knowledge artifacts. Current approaches to quality tend to
                focus on system specific events or stakeholder mistakes, but as the health care
                environment has evolved, quality assurance must validate data during creation and as
                it transitions between systems.</para>
            <para>While improving patient safety and data quality are key focuses of this paper,
                financial theory is also applied to demonstrate how cost and time variables will
                impact quality assurance. It is critical that data validation and assurance methods
                are implemented optimally to reduce the risk of hazards or patient safety issues
                while accounting for organizational constraints and pressures. [20]</para>
