            Overview</title>
        <para>Systemic Harmonization and Interoperability Enhancement for Laboratory Data (SHIELD)
            is a public-private collaboration that started in 2015 with a singular focus: improving
            the interoperability and utility of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test data. To accomplish
            their mission of being able to “Describe the same test the same way anywhere in the
            Healthcare ecosystem”, SHIELD is working to develop a solution that focuses on:</para>

        <title>Real World Evidence (RWE) and Standards Overview</title>
        <para>Real world evidence (RWE) using RWD collected as part of routine clinical care, has
            been heralded as an answer to many of the woes of our medical system. A vision has been
            made popular that suggests a wealth of untapped data – electronic health records (EHR),
            medical imaging, mobile apps, and, more recently, low-cost gene sequencing and wearable
            devices, unlocked using artificial intelligence and cloud computing – is a path to
            better diagnostics, personalized treatments, and early disease prevention for millions.
            Interoperable Health Data may help medicine realize the future in the same way in which
            other industries have advanced – such as banking, the “internet of things” and online
            shopping, thereby stressing the importance of establishing the Laboratory
            Interoperability Data Repository (LIDR) and related infrastructure. The vision of a
            national interoperable health information system has been elusive because of siloed
            clinical care data , incompatible health information technology (IT) systems, and
            proprietary software that make health information difﬁcult to exchange, analyze, and
            interpret. </para>
        <para>Given the number of distinct information systems and care delivery organizations in
            the ecosystem (e.g., primary care, specialists, laboratories, other care teams),
            multiple variations exist in how data is collected, manipulated, transmitted, and
            effectively used. The problem is not the systems per se, but rather the difficulty of
            data exchange between systems or data incompatibility. Medical data range in format from
            narrative, textual data to numerical measurements, recorded signals, photographs,
            drawings, and more. There is also the challenge of the volume of data recorded. Several
            different observations of a patient are often made concurrently, the observation of the
            same patient parameter made at several points in time, or both. [1] It is also important
            to keep a record of the circumstances under which data are obtained. For example, is a
            blood pressure reading taken on the arm or the leg, had the patient just exercised, what
            kind of device was used, etc. </para>
        <para>Representing these data in various, disparate information systems introduces
            additional opportunities for inefficiencies, redundancies, and inconsistencies. Each
            system has a proprietary, standard, or ad-hoc information model and is typically
            configured to satisfy organization-specific needs, resulting in differences in data
            capture and storage between and within systems. This is the current reality, as
            electronic health data are represented in unpredictable and denormalized forms. This
            reduces the quality of data processing and ability to conduct safe and reliable
            analytics. Numerous scholarly and practical efforts illustrate the challenges of using
            observational data for safe patient care, comparative effectiveness research, and
            analysis including recording biases, workflow differences, and issues with variations in
            data collection, such as invalid, inconsistent, and missing data. [2] </para>
        <para>Aggregated RWE and reliable analytics would benefit from implementable methodologies
            that address interoperability and data aggregation gaps to help establish a health data
            ecosystem capable of widespread use in regulatory efforts, public health surveillance,
            research, and care delivery. To achieve safe and effective information retrieval and
            reproducible search and query practices across various settings, the following
            constructs are needed to successfully build, maintain, and analyze data/resources across
            key biomedical concepts of interest. </para>
        <section>
            <title>Data Interoperability Tooling Overview</title>
            <para>A generalized definition of interoperable health data that supports reliable RWE
                analytics asserts that data recorded and encoded at the time of creation should
                accurately reflect the meaning intended by the health care professional who created
                the data. In the current ecosystem, it can be a very manual, error-prone, and
                sometimes challenging process to determine if data received from entity A is
                equivalent to data from entity B and if it is interpreted across each setting as the
                data was originally intended at the point of origin. Data interoperability tooling,
                such as a Knowledge Management Platform, that can ingest disparate health data and
                knowledge sources and harmonize them into a common model and change management
                system could help in ensuring that the data are reliably computed and/or transmitted
                between health information systems without any change in meaning. The original
                meaning, as intended by the first entity, should be fully communicated
                electronically and, upon receipt, equally understood by the receiving entity. This
                type of knowledge platform could serve as data interoperability tooling that can
                determine equivalence between concepts and data sets from various organizations. </para>
            <para>To facilitate such tooling, data must be represented by a normal form that can
                safely and reliably support data analysis and be used to aggregate data using a
                standard or non-standard input form or exchange mechanism. Examples of such data
                models include Health Level 7 (HL7) Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI)
                efforts, including the HL7 Analysis Normal Form (ANF) specification. The model to
                support a Knowledge Management Platform should meet the following evolutionary
                design criteria: </para>
            <itemizedlist>

                        normalizing disparate health data can be processed by health IT systems and
                        understood by most healthcare providers without reference to private or
                        inaccessible information.</para>

                        an equivalent result.</para>
                </listitem>

                    <para><emphasis role="bold">Useful</emphasis>: The model is fit-for-purpose—it
                        has practical value for data analysis, in support of clinical decision
                        support, research, and population health that requires information
                        aggregated across health IT systems.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <para>Normalization of disparate health data and knowledge is defined as "the ability to
                identify every representational format that confers the same meaning as being
                equivalent (i.e., unambiguous representation)." [3] This
                transformation/normalization would involve a data instance to data instance
                transformation. An example could be John Doe's Systolic Blood Pressure measurement
                taken on June 4, 2019 represented as a Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)
                Observation instance, which is then transformed to a common data model/normal form
                instance representing this same data. Transformation, in this case, is not a simple
                endeavor that one can hope to implement on clinical data. It will likely involve
                navigating disparate data structure trees and include variable representations to
                then generate a well-formed terminology expression. It is most likely possible to
                target sub-domains for consistent transformation, such as all quantitative
                laboratory results, but in some cases, it may be that each detailed clinical model
                needs its own unique transformation. </para>
            <para>Currently, there are three basic categories of errors that might be associated
                with attempts at normalizing clinical data representation: </para>
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors associated with normalization of content of the terminology </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors associated with normalization of the semantics of the terminology
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Errors that result from ambiguous or misleading interactions between the
                        structured clinical input and presentation of compound terminology to
                        clinician end-users </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>A number of options exist for expressing transformation logic and for executing
                the transformation on specific instances of clinical data for normalization. These
                range from transformation languages to expensive middleware options commonly used in
                healthcare interfaces. The suitability of a chosen transformation language highly
                depends on the format of the source data, and the quality and accuracy of the
                transformation is left to the transformation author. Examples of transformation
                languages include extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), FHIR
                Mapping Language, and Query/View/Transformation (QVT). Often referred to as “data
                wrangling”, these transformation processes often require mapping data from one “raw”
                data form into another format with the intent of making it more valuable for
                downstream purposes such as analytics. </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Data Liquidity Overview</title>
            <para>To support RWE analytics and data aggregation, there is a desire to “reduce the
                amount of data wrangling” and one-off transformations across the ecosystem and
                instead enable “data liquidity”, or the ability of data to flow throughout the
                health data ecosystem easily and securely so that it is quickly available to
                clinicians, decision makers, laboratories, patients, and others when they need. A
                robust information architecture and scalable solution to enable this ideal state
                requires a common understanding of data and a method to support
                knowledge-representation and assertional and procedural rules based on common
                terminology and statement models. If a shareable architecture were able to be
                implemented across the ecosystem, health data and knowledge could potentially be
                represented in a way that is both applicable at the interoperability-enterprise and
                project-specific levels. </para>
            <para>Another pragmatic methodology would be to engage vendors and incentivize them to
                implement an open, common data model and produce shareable output in interoperable,
                reproducible, and understandable formats that could then be ingested by other
                systems. Major U.S. EHR vendors, which represent > 80% of the U.S. healthcare EHR
                implementations, represent a possible avenue to normalizing and aggregating
                EHR-based data in the U.S. on a broad scale. Individually, each vendor has
                independently attempted to create such clinical data resources and product offerings
                for their user communities. These efforts entail attempts to align, normalize, and
                aggregate the EHR data held by each individual client into a large, de-identified
                data enclave for purposes of data analytics, quality improvement, and research.
                Unfortunately, these independent efforts are proprietary and do not extend beyond
                the vendor-user community. Further, the data normalization and representation
                process remains a "black box" and cannot be independently verified for semantic
                correctness, data and information loss or gains, or appropriate application of
                metadata standards. In fact, these vendor-centric efforts face the same issues with
                vendor-centric data alignment and reuse on a smaller scale. [4-5] Despite these
                weaknesses, an opportunity exists to collaborate with EHR vendors to normalize and
                apply metadata standards safely and reliably to the EHR data created by their
                clients. To capitalize on this opportunity, vendors must be allowed to create unique
                value in their data offerings to the clientele but also be required to expose these
                data to the broader community such that data collected by numbers of vendors can be
                safely and reliably aggregated for research, public health, clinical quality
                improvement and regulatory uses as described by SHIELD. </para>

        <section>
            <title>Metadata overview</title>
            <para>An important construct for enabling RWE analytics, knowledge management, data
                integration, and decision support, is adoption and reproducible encoding of health
                data using biomedical terminologies. Acceleration and development of EHR systems
                have precipitated the emergence of “standard terminologies” and their widespread
                adoption in the health data community. These standard terminologies include
                Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®), the Logical
                Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) and RxNorm. </para>
            <para>While these standards are widely implemented and adopted, aggregation and
                analytics can be difficult because there is no standard representation across these
                terminologies. Traversing the data models of these various terminology standards in
                an integrated way is non-trivial because SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm each use
                different formalisms and tools for their representation. Various terminologies have
                different semantics, models, release cycles, and versioning mechanisms. [6] </para>
            <para>Ideally, to support RWE analytics and aggregation, enterprise terminology requires
                an integrated terminology using a common representation (metadata) and management. A
                common terminology model, such as HL7 Standardized Terminology Knowledge Base (also
                known as TermINology Knowledge Architecture [Tinkar]) would allow the following
                analytics on top of aggregated RWE data sets [7]: </para>

            <title>Analytic Environments Overview</title>
            <para>Integrated analytics environments assist in creating and automating data pipelines
                and workflows to deliver actionable information to a wide variety of end users.
                These environments extract data from various data sources, ideally into an
                integrated knowledge base, housed in a central ecosystem – thereby reducing data
                silos, enhancing security and governance, and eliminating system redundancies. For
                data analytics conducted using RWE, analytics environments will be dependent on a
                variety of knowledge bases and datasets that may have differing fields, despite some
                potential overlap. A vast variety of biomedical and administrative knowledge present
                the basis for RWE analytics and knowledge management of these disparate datasets is
                a major element of consideration to facilitate RWE analytics. Knowledge management
                includes the creation, discovery, and application of knowledge assets to facilitate
                sharing and re-use across the ecosystem. </para>
            <para>The ability to use interoperable syntax and semantics between data sources is a
                critical requirement to support effective knowledge management and reliable
                analytics of disparate RWE datasets. Use of industry standards for syntax and
                semantics helps facilitate integration; however, not all implementation
                considerations are planned for and adopted and additional efforts are needed to

            within and between systems while maintaining meaning and all associated and pertinent
            information. Interoperability primarily focuses on two aspects, structural and meaning

            between and within both organizations and standards poses as a major patient safety
            issue in the healthcare system. A test with a given LIVD LOINC code can be performed
            within a lab and as it is transmitted to the LIS, the test can be assigned a different
            LIS LOINC code that does not capture all of the pertinent information. Even within the
            organization the interoperability of data is threatened, so when data is then
            transferred from the lab’s LIS to a hospital's EHR that lack of data interoperability
            can compound as the LIS LOINC code is assigned another, potentially different EHR LOINC
            code.</para>

        <title>Clinical Statement Overview</title>
        <para>A clinical statement is a general informatics term. It is a definite and clear
            representation that a clinically significant fact or situation was observed to exist or
            happened, or that a particular procedure was requested. A clinical statement can be
            expressed as a narrative that provides a written account that can be naturally read by
            humans, as well as a normal form which is a machine-processable representation of the
            statement's data as a standardized and encoded fundamental form. [8]</para>
        <para>Clinical Input Form (CIF) is also a general informatics term. It describes the manner
            by which clinicians author clinical statements and enter them into their organizations’
            EHR. CIFs have an impact as to how information is presented to the clinicians and how
            they enter the data. CIFs might be generated by natural language processing or may use
            models that constrain structured input to allow only certain values to be entered, such
            as a drop-down list or radio button, or breaking up large chunks of related information
            into smaller parts. [8]</para>
        <para>Today, clinical statements are often represented in unpredictable and denormalized
            forms, which makes reliable and safe decision support challenging and reduces the
            quality of other types of data processing. ANF is an approach to clinical statements
            that ensures the statement representation is reproducible and scalable, with the
            adherence to principles of being simple, reproducible, and use case driven, with a clean
            separation between statement concerns and terminology concerns. [8]</para>
        <para>In linguistics, words have their very own definitions, however, if it’s not paired
            with proper sentence structure, the words convey very little meaning and are open to
            interpretation. When this framework is applied to the healthcare system, clinical data,
            and more specifically clinical statements, we need <emphasis role="italic"
                >terminology</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">structure</emphasis> to convey a

It does not provide a high level overveiw like the other sections in the background and is too technical? Perhaps we move this to architecture section?"?>Modularity
            and Versioning Overview<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
        <para>When dealing with the complexities of the various architectural layers of the below
            informatics architectural separation of concerns, one of the most important things to
            note is that any one of the architectural layers will be undergoing modifications at any
            given point in time, as various Standards Development Organizations go through each of
            their various drafting, balloting, and approval lifecycles. Therefore, it is important
            to establish a foundation for versioning and modularity architecture that allows changes
            and subchanges to be referenced uniquely so that all parties can be on the same page as
            to a particular version.</para>
        <para>For example, the following diagram shows how each module could be given a unique
            version number and contain all layers of the architectural stack. In the instance that a
            particular versioned module needs to be extended, an extension module could be added to
            that main versioned module without the need to go to a completely new full module
            version. This arrangement accounts for the constant change in the healthcare
            interoperability space while still allowing two organizations to baseline on the same
            version for testing or exchange purposes.</para>
        <para>In software engineering, modularity refers to the extent to which software may be
            divided into smaller modules. Modularity emphasizes separating the functionality of a
            program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything
            necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. A module interface
            expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module, and the elements
            defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. Modular programming is closely
            related to object-oriented programming, having the same goal of facilitating
            construction of large software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces
            (i.e., 'polymorphism by encapsulation' or 'composition over inheritance'). With modular
            programming, concerns are separated such that modules perform logically discrete
            functions, interacting through well-defined interfaces. Often modules form a directed
            acyclic graph (DAG); in this case, a cyclic dependency between modules is seen as
            indicating that these should be a single module. In the case where modules do form a DAG
            they can be arranged as a hierarchy, where the lowest-level modules are independent,
            depending on no other modules, and higher-level modules depend on lower-level ones. A
            particular program or library is a top-level module of its own hierarchy, but can in
            turn be seen as a lower-level module of a higher-level program, library, or
            system.</para>
